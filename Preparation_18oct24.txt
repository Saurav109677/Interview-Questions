Q1. What is the difference between == and equals() in Java?
- (==) It compares object references (memory addresses) to check if two object references point to the same object in memory.
- (equals) It compares the contents (values) of two objects to check if they are logically equivalent.

String s1 = new String("hello");
String s2 = new String("hello");
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false, because s1 and s2 refer to different objects in memory.
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true, because the content of s1 and s2 is the same.

Q2. Explain the concept of garbage collection. How does the JVM manage memory?
