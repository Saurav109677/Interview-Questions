1. Singleton Design Pattern 
2. How to break singleton pattern and solution
3. Factory Design Pattern -
  - AndroidDeveloper.java and WebDeveloper.java
  - DeveloperClient (main) need not to create or bother about how to get the object of the developer.
    simply create (EmployeeFactory.java). this includes the logic to pass the object of developer according to the type provide
     e.g EmployeeFactory.getEmployee("ANDROID DEVELOPER") / "WEB DEVELOPER". 
     DeveloperClient need not worry how to get the developer. (Loose coupling)
   Advantages - 
   - Focus on main logic rather on implementaino of the developers
   - loose coupled
